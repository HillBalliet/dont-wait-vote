1. Put your dummy data here! Don't worry about sorting, the program handles that automatically
2. Text goes in single quotes, i.e. 'Governor'. Numbers do not, i.e. 47. true and false are lowercase without quotes. If you don't know what to put, just write null
3. When done, scroll to the bottom and hit "Make New Branch." Title it something short and memorable. It will appear as branch.voterforastra.org.
